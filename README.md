## ✨ Features

- 🚀 Quick and easy Minecraft instance management
- 🎯 One-click launcher
- ⚙️ Simple configuration
- 📦 Automatic dependency handling
- 🔧 Customizable game settings

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Installation - All Platforms

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Earth1283/PyMCL.git
cd PyMCL

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2️⃣ Launch Minecraft

```bash
# Start the launcher
python main.py
```

### ⚡️ Quick EXE - Windows Only

Download the exe from the latest release [here](https://github.com/Earth1283/PyMCL/releases)

Double click the exe, and you're done!

### Clearing the Cache
To clear the icon cache, you can either:
- Go to the `Tools` menu and select `Clear Icon Cache`.
- Go to the `Mods` page and click the `Clear Icon Cache` button.

### Mod Explorer
The mod explorer has been updated to a new 3-column grid layout. Each mod is displayed as a card with its icon, name, and a download badge. The search bar is now a floating bar at the top of the page.

Clicking on a mod card (but not the download button) will open a new window with the mod's full description, rendered from Markdown. To download a mod, you must first select a game version and loader from the "Launch" page. If you have not selected a version and loader, you will be prompted to do so before the download can begin.

## 🎮 Usage

### GUI Mode
Simply run:
```bash
python launcher.py
```

### EXE Mode
Simply double click that exe file. Period.
